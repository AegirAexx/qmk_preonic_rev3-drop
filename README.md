# Preonic QMK Firmware

## Description

My version of the Preonic Rev3_DROP QMK firmware. It's a fork of the original QMK firmware, but with support for is-IS keyboard layout.

I set it up with the idea of using at my day job as a programmer / developer.

This is very much work in progress.

Feel free to fork and improve it.

Happy hacking!
